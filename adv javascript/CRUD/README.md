# CRUD Operations: Meaning and The Date of Introduction 

The CRUD paradigm was designed as a method of functions for improving persistent data storage. The term was first popularized in the early 1980s by English information technology consultant and author James Martin. In his book, “Managing the data base environment”, James Martin referred to applications that create, read, update, and delete data.
In modern software engineering, CRUD serves as an approach for designing web applications since it provides a memorable scheme for reminding developers of how to create comprehensive user-friendly tools. In such apps, users interact with a database by creating a new record, accessing data in the UI by reading it, editing or updating data, and deleting it.

Each CRUD operation can be mapped to a corresponding HTTP protocol method:  
* Create -> Post
* Read -> Get
* Update -> Put
* Delete -> Delete.
